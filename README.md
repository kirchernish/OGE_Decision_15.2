# OGE_Decision_15.2
This is a program that solves problem 15.2 from the OGE in computer science. The input data includes only the task, then the program itself determines the type of task. The program outputs the code and the result. P.S. the program is without an interface and in Russian. Don't judge strictly, this is my first program without any libraries. I have been studying python not so much for 1 year. Demo
